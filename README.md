# 📊 Regression Analysis in Excel

## 🛍️ Project Overview

This project is based on a case study for **The Trendy Shopper**, a fast-growing e-commerce company. The goal is to analyze how **product prices** and **discounts** influence **total customer spending**, helping the company improve its pricing and discount strategies through **predictive modeling**.

Using **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression in Excel**, we uncover relationships between variables like product cost, discount, quantity purchased, and total amount spent.
